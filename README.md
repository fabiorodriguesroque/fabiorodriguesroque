### Hi, I'm Fábio 👋

Welcome to my profile, I live in 📍 Aveiro, PT. At the moment I work as Full Stack Developer with VueJS and Laravel, but svelteKit has caught my attention and for now I'm using my free time to develop some examples with svelteKit.

```typescript

const languages: string[]  = ['PHP', 'Typescript' 'Javascript', 'HTML', 'CSS'];
const frameworks: string[] = ['Laravel', 'SvelteKit', 'NuxtJS'];
const tools: string[]      = ['GIT', 'Docker', 'Asana', 'Trello', 'Jira'];
const others: string[] = ['VueJS', 'Inertia', 'Livewire', 'AlpineJS'];

```
